<h4>Cyberinfrastructures</h4>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://openkim.org" target="_blank">OpenKIM</a> &#8212;
  The Open Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (OpenKIM) project archives
  interatomic potentials, develops API standards to make potentials portable between
  simulation codes, and develops methods to assess the accuracy and transferability
  of potentials.
 </li>

 <li><a href="http://cams.mse.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">CAMS</a> &#8212;
  The cyberinfrastructure for Atomistic Materials Science (CAMS) serves
  as a forum for disseminating new atomistic scale methodologies, and
  educating non-experts and the next generation of computational materials
  scientists.
 </li>
</ul>

<h4>Materials Data Repositories</h4>
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.materialsproject.org/" target="_blank">Materials Project</a> &#8212;
  The Materials Project provides open web-based access to information computed using electronic
  structure methods on known and predicted materials as well as powerful analysis tools to inspire
  and design novel materials.</li>
 </li>

 <li><a href="http://www.aflowlib.org//" target="_blank">AFLOW</a> &#8212;
  The Automatic-flow (AFLOW) project is a searchable repository of material properties obtained
  using high-throughput ab initio electronic structure computations.
 </li>
</ul>

 <li><a href="http://nomad-repository.eu/cms/" target="_blank">NoMaD</a> &#8212;
  The NoMaD (Novel Materials Discovery) Repository hosts, organizes and shares
  material data calculated using ab initio electronic-structure methods.
 </li>
</ul>

<h4>Material Informatics</h4>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://brinson.mech.northwestern.edu/research/Nanomine.html" target="_blank">NanoMine</a> &#8212;
