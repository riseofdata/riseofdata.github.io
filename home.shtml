This website is a forum for members of the materials research community to
discuss issues related to the increasing use of large data sets as part of
scientific research in materials science.  This includes issues related to

<ol>
<li>The creation and use of materials cyberinfrastructures</li>

<li>Support for junior and senior researchers engaged in infrastructure creation.</li>

<li>Best practices in data handling and management.</li>

<li>Extraction of knowledge from data as opposed to pure data mining.</li>

<li>Education of materials researchers in the age of big data.</li>

<li>Development of grass root standards and funding agency support.</li>
</ol>
