<h3>UMD Workshop (June 29-30, 2015)</h3>
The current effort to understand the implications of the
&#8220;Rise of Data in Materials Reseach&#8221; began
at a 2-day NSF Workshop held on the campus of the University of Maryland (UMD)
during June 29-30, 2015.  The workshop was organized by
<a href="http://www.aem.umn.edu/~tadmor/" target="_blank">Prof. Ellad Tadmor</a> and
<a href="https://www.aem.umn.edu/people/faculty/bio/elliott.shtml" target="_blank">Prof. Ryan Elliott</a> from the University of Minnesota and
<a href="http://www.mse.umd.edu/faculty/takeuchi" target="_blank">Prof. Ichiro Takeuchi</a>
at UMD.  Funding was provided by the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> through
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1542923" target="_blank">Grant DMR-1542923</a>.

<p>
The workshop was attended by about 80 leading
materials researchers from academia, industry and government with experience in
both hard and soft matter and theory, computations and experiments. The
participants were divided into groups to address the types of questions
described in the <a href="home.shtml" target="content-id">Overview section</a>.
A description of the group topics and membership, as well as the presentations
given with attached audio are provided below. The meeting was also attended
by Linda Sapochak, Alexis Lewis and Daryl Hess from NSF.

<h3>Group Topics and Membership</h3>
The Workshop participants were divided into six groups each tasked with a
different aspect of the impact of data on materials research. Two group
members were selected to be Group Co-Leaders who gave initial presentations
(see <a href="#talks">below</a>) and were responsible for summarizing
their Group's conclusions following an in-depth discussion. The topics
handled by each Group and the Group membership are listed below.

<h4>Group 1 &#8212; Materials Cyberinfrastructures</h4>
<ul>
<li>
What is the state-of-the-art in data sharing? How is data currently exchanged in collaborations? What are current bottlenecks? What do researchers wish they had?
</li>

<li>
How do we get people from different disciplines to collaborate?
</li>

<li>
How do we get theorists and experimentalists to collaborate in data sharing and integration?
</li>

<li>
How do we create a connected federation of cyberinfrastructures allowing researchers to communicate and exchange information?
</li>

<li>
How do we make sure cyberinfrastructures are maintained and upgraded to support and take advantage of the rapidly evolving digital revolution?
</li>

<li>
How do we encourage and support efforts to create and make available to the entire community “data translator” or “data exchange” tools that convert data between the many formats used by various cyberinfrastructures?
</li>

<li>
How can we learn from successful efforts in other fields such as iMechanica?
</li>
</ul>
