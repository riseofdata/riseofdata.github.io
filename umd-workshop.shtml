<h3>UMD Workshop (June 29-30, 2015)</h3>
The current effort to understand the implications of the
&#8220;Rise of Data in Materials Reseach&#8221; began
at a 2-day NSF Workshop held on the campus of the University of Maryland (UMD)
during June 29-30, 2015.  The workshop was attended by about 80 leading
materials researchers from academia, industry and government with experience in
both hard and soft matter and theory, computations and experiments. The
participants were divided into groups to address the types of questions
described in the <a href="home.shtml" target="content-id">Overview section</a>.
