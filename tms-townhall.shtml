<p>
<b>Who should attend?</b><br>
This town hall meeting is free and open to anyone (whether registered for the TMS meeting
or not) who is interested in expressing an opinion on the role of data in
materials research.

<p>
<b>What is this about?</b><br>
As explained in the <a href="background.shtml" target="content-id">Background section</a>, materials research is in a state of flux as it grapples with how to address the
technical, ethical, and philosophical issues associated with the increasing
prominence of data in materials research.  These topics were discussed by
work groups at a
<a href="umd-workshop.shtml" target="content-id">2-day workshop at UMD in June 2015</a>.
The recommendations from these groups will be presented at this meeting. In addition,
interested participants can give short 5-minute talks on any issue related to
data in materials research (see registration details below). This will be followed by
a public debate.  The meeting will be recorded and the feedback obtained will be
integrated into a report being compiled to accurately reflect our communityâ€™s
perspective on the role of data in materials research.  You can also comment now
on our <a href="forum.shtml" target="content-id">discussion forum</a>.

<p>
<b>When and where is the meeting?</b><br>
The meeting will be held on Wednesday February 17, 2016 at 12-3pm (depending on the
number of external talks) in the Legends Ballroom D at the
<a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/nashville" target="_blank">Omni Nashville Hotel</a>, which serves as the TMS Headquarters hotel, in Nashville, TN across the
