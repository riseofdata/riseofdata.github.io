<h3>Welcome!</h3>
This website is a forum for members of the materials research community to
discuss issues related to the increasing use of large data sets as part of
scientific research in materials science.  The following themes are
considered:

<br><br>

<ol>
<li>The creation and use of materials cyberinfrastructures.</li>

<li>Support for junior and senior researchers engaged in infrastructure creation.</li>

<li>Best practices for data handling and management.</li>

<li>Extraction of knowledge from data as opposed to pure data mining.</li>

<li>Education of materials researchers in the age of big data.</li>

<li>Development of grassroots standards and support from funding agencies.</li>
</ol>

<p>These themes are discussed in more depth <a href="/themes">here</a>.
The themes served as the basis for working group discussions at a
<a href="/umd-workshop">Workshop</a> held at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD
 in June 2015.  The discussion will continue at a <a href="/tms-townhall">Town Hall Meeting</a> at
the TMS Annual Meeting in Nashville, TN in February 2016.
