Materials research is currently undergoing a revolution driven by the
generation and integration of vast amounts of data through experimental
and computational means (see figure on right).
This development has great potential to
dramatically advance the creation of predictive methodologies coupling
theory, computation and experimentation for the design of new materials.
At the same time, it is important that a focus on data does not degrade
the “thought-based” approach to Science where enlightened thinking,
informed by experiment and computations, leads to simple models that
capture the essence of physical phenomena.

This figure shows the number of citations per year of articles making
use of data-driven approaches in materials research. The increasing
numbers of citations over time indicate both the increasing number
of publications in this area and the increasing interest in the subject.

The materials research community must grapple with the data revolution
to determine how to best take advantage of it while avoiding the pitfalls.
There are many questions.  Some deal with technical issues, such as best
practices for the storage, handling, manipulation, and sharing of vast
datasets. Others deal with more fundamental aspects of our discipline, such as
whether and how the education of materials researchers must change, how the
contribution of young researchers to data infrastructures can be recognized,
and how new knowledge can be extracted from data. Answers to these questions
will inform our own field moving forward and provide a roadmap to funding
agencies in determining how to make best use of limited resources.
These issues for the basis of <a href="/themes">six themes</a>
explored by this project.</p>

<p>
This website along with a series of workshops are designed to engage the
materials research community in this discussion.  The workshop series began at
a <a href="
/umd-workshop">2-day NSF Workshop</a>
held on the campus of the University of Maryland (UMD)
during June 29-30, 2015. A follow-up
<a href="
/tms-townhall">Town Hall Meeting</a>
will take place at the TMS Annual Meeting in
Nashville, TN on February 17, 2016. Registration is now open!
