<h3>Themes</h3>

<p>Issues related to the Rise of Data in Materials Research can
be divided into six major themese as outlined below.

<h4>Theme 1 &#8212; Materials Cyberinfrastructures</h4>
<ul>
<li>
What is the state-of-the-art in data sharing? How is data currently exchanged in collaborations? What are current bottlenecks? What do researchers wish they had?
</li>

<li>
How do we get people from different disciplines to collaborate?
</li>

<li>
How do we get theorists and experimentalists to collaborate in data sharing and integration?
</li>

<li>
How do we create a connected federation of cyberinfrastructures allowing researchers to communicate and exchange information?
</li>

<li>
How do we make sure cyberinfrastructures are maintained and upgraded to support and take advantage of the rapidly evolving digital revolution?
</li>

<li>
How do we encourage and support efforts to create and make available to the entire community “data translator” or “data exchange” tools that convert data between the many formats used by various cyberinfrastructures?
</li>

<li>
How can we learn from successful efforts in other fields such as iMechanica?
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Theme 2 &#8212; Enabling Infrastructure Creation</h4>
<ul>

<li>
How do we enable researchers (in particular junior researchers) to contribute to data infrastructures when they are currently only rewarded for doing “Science”?
</li>

<li>
How do we track researcher contributions to open tools and online resources?
</li>

<li>
How do we (and should we) encourage policy changes at institutions on promotion and tenure?
</li>

<li>
How do we obtain funding for initial creation and sustainment of infrastructures once they exist and reach a certain level of maturity?
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Theme 3 &#8212; Data Management and Handling</h4>

<ul>
<li>
What are best practices for data curation (gathering and annotating data), documentation, completeness, and uncertainties, so that data is meaningful when exchanged?
</li>

<li>
What are the suitable ontologies and taxonomies (common classifications and terminologies) to be used in labeling and exchanging materials data?
</li>

<li>
What can be said in general about metadata that should accompany data?
</li>

<li>
How do we get computer science people involved and interested?
</li>

<li>
What are the advantages and disadvantages of archiving arbitrary information provided by researchers versus enforcing machine-readable controlled vocabularies?
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Theme 4 &#8212; Knowledge from Data</h4>

<ul>
<li>
How can data be used to do Science?
</li>

<li>
What data/properties are needed? What are the predictive models that would use data?
</li>

<li>
How do we extract new knowledge from data?
</li>

<li>
Philosophically, how do we think about “Science” in this new emerging paradigm of “big data”?
</li>

<li>
How do we take advantage of “negative results” published in online repositories, which are currently not normally published?
</li>

<li>
How do we balance data mining approaches with “thought-based” Science?
</li>
</ul>


<h4>Theme 5 &#8212; Education of Materials Researchers</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Does “Big Data” have the potential to make us better teachers?
</li>

<li>
How do we teach people to use data to do science?
</li>

<li>
How do we prepare materials researchers for data-centric careers and should we be doing so?
</li>

<li>
What role do our libraries/librarians have with respect to data? How should their mission be redefined within in the new digital world?  How can they be more involved in conducting and facilitating data-driven research?
</li>

</ul>


<h4>Theme 6 &#8212; Grassroots Standards and Government Support</h4>

<ul>
<li>
What areas of materials research are ready for standardization?
</li>

<li>
Will it be helpful to define standards as a community or is it better to let standards grow organically with the inevitable duplication and wasted effort?
</li>

<li>
How can funding agencies assist the process?
</li>

<li>
How can the Material Genome Initiative (MGI) and Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) efforts be leveraged?
</li>

<li>
Would the creation of a “Materials Institute” similar to IPAM, IMA, CECAM, or a “National Materials Data Vault” with data storage capabilities and IT support for researchers be helpful?
</li>
</ul>
