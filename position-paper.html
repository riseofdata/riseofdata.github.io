<h3>Position Paper</h3>

<p>The end goal of the &#8220;Rise of Data&#8221; project is to compile a
<i>Position Paper</i> that reflects the range of views in the materials
community on whether and how the field needs adapt to the increasing
prominence of data in materials research.  This document is based
on information gathered at workshops and meetings organized as part of
this effort and community feedback on our <a href="/forum">discussion forum</a>.
