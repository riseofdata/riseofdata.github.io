## Rise of Data in Materials Research

This website is a forum for members of the materials research community to
discuss issues related to the increasing use of large data sets as part of
scientific research.  This includes issues related to

1. The creation and use of materials cyberinfrastructures

2. Support for junior and senior reearchers engaged in infrastructure creation.

3. Best practices in data handling and management.

4. Extraction of knowledge from data as opposed to pure data mining.

5. Education of materials researchers in the age of big data.

6. Development of grass root standards and funding agency support.

This effort is funded through an NSF grant (DMR-1542923) led by
Prof. Ellad B. Tadmor and Prof. Ryan S. Elliott (University of Minnesota).
