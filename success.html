<b>Designing DNA-grafted particles that self-assemble into desired crystalline structures using the genetic algorithm</b> by Babji Srinivasan et al. (<i>PNAS</i>, 110(46):18431–18435, 2013.)
The traditional, Edisonian method of research involves taking a system and examining its properties. A preferred alternative is to target a suite of properties and then design the most appropriate system in this context. Here we illustrate such a design approach for the self-assembly of colloids grafted with single-stranded DNA. When two types of colloids grafted with complementary ssDNA sequences are mixed, DNA hybridization can lead to the formation of ordered colloidal crystals. We use the genetic algorithm to design ssDNA-grafted particles that will assemble into a desired structure. Our methodology is easily generalizable, fast and highly selective, and not only accurately reproduces the parameters relevant to four currently realized crystals but also elucidates four currently unobserved structures.

<b>Adaptive strategies for materials design using uncertainties</b> by Prasanna V. Balachandran et al. (<i>Scientific Reports</i>, 6:19660, 2015).
Materials design is an optimization problem, where we seek to find materials with targeted response for a desired application in an accelerated manner. However, the response surface is often complex and multi-modal. We compare several adaptive design strategies using a data set of 223 M<sub>2</sub>AX family of compounds for which the elastic properties have been computed using density functional theory. The ultimate goal is to obtain a material with desired elastic properties in as few iterations as possible. We examine how the choice of data set size, regressor and selector impact the design. We find that selectors that use information about the prediction uncertainty outperform those that don’t.
